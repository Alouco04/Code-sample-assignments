# PSE-assignments
Code for various assignments at the PSE

The PSE-Assignments folder contents codes that I have used during my curriculum. They are meant to highlight my degree of familiarity with the programming
language R and Stata.

The name of the folder corresponds to the topic covered in the assignments in class. The filed starting with "HW" are codes for homework for the class
"Measurement of Policy Outcomes". The "Applied economics project" file, has the code for an applied econometrics project in which the goal was to reproduce
and extend a paper that was given to us. Although this was a group assignement, I only uploaded my code. Lastly, the "Midterm" file corresponds to a midterm
for a the "Economics of Global Poverty" class that I took while at the University of California Davis. It is the only Stata file here.
